Welcome to Viewer's Documentation!
==================================
The Viewer project is part of the MIT Media Lab Digital Certificates incubation project. We're looking for feedback,
contributions, and general discussion. This is not currently intended for production release, but we are improving
our approach for future releases. Read more about the Digital Certificates Project at http://certificates.media.mit.edu/.
