Quick Start
===========

Steps
-----

1. [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation)
    - There's a lot of introductory information; installation steps start at the #installation anchor for your os. For
example, mac instructions start at [https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/#installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/#installation)

2. Git clone the repository

    `git clone https://github.com/digital-certificates/cert-viewer.git`

3. Build the container with docker-compose

    `docker-compose build`

4. Start the container

    `docker-compose up`

5. Access the cert-viewer pre-populated with test data at `http://<hostname>:5000`, where hostname is given by
    `docker-machine ip`


About Docker Setup
------------------
The quick start steps do the following:

1. Creates a container that runs the cert-viewer Flask app with MongoDB using Docker Compose [details](http://containertutorials.com/docker-compose/flask-mongo-compose.html)
2. Seeds the MongoDB database with sample fake certificates. This data is located in the mongo-seed folder
3. Starts the container. This configuration exposes port 5000.


Limitations/Warnings
--------------------
- The quick start configuration is for demo purposes and not intended for production release. See "Detailed Installation"
- As of now, the mongo instance is populated with 2 unverified certificates; they are linked to on the main page. Click
'Verify' to see details on how verification can fail.
